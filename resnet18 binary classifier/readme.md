# Resnet18 Binary Classifier

The code I provided is for training a ResNet18 binary classifier on custom images data and visualizing the evaluation metrics over the epochs. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Importing Libraries:
The first step is to import the required libraries for your project. In this example, we are using the torch library for creating and training the ResNet18 model, torchvision for loading the pre-trained ResNet18 model, numpy for handling arrays and numerical operations, and matplotlib for creating plots and visualizations.

2. Loading the Data:
Next, we load the custom image data that we want to use to train the ResNet18 classifier. We use the torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder method to load the data and the torch.utils.data.DataLoader method to create data loaders that we can use during training. We also apply some data transformations to resize, crop, normalize the images.

3. Defining the ResNet18 Model:
In this step, we use the torchvision.models.resnet18 method to load the pre-trained ResNet18 model. We then modify the model to suit our needs by changing the number of output classes and adding a fully connected layer to the end of the model. Finally, we move the model to the GPU if it is available, otherwise, we use the CPU.

4. Defining the Loss Function and Optimizer:
In this step, we define the loss function and optimizer that we will use during training. We use the nn.CrossEntropyLoss method as the loss function, and the torch.optim.SGD method as the optimizer. We specify the learning rate of 0.001.

5. Training the Model:
Finally, we train the ResNet18 model for 10 epochs, which means that we go through the entire training data 10 times. At each epoch, we keep track of various evaluation metrics such as loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We update the model parameters using the optimizer and calculate the metrics for both the training data and the validation data. After training, we can use these metrics to evaluate the performance of the model and make improvements if necessary.

6. Plot the evaluation metrics:
The code uses matplotlib to visualize how the evaluation metrics change over the epochs. This is useful to see if the model is overfitting or underfitting and to choose the best number of epochs to train the model for.

7. Save the trained model:
The code saves the trained model so that it can be used later.

This code is just a starting point, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific needs, such as changing the data loaders, the loss function, the optimizer, and the number of epochs.
